00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,510
Hello everyone, this is Shimanto Shorkar

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,390
and today I will be diving into a

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,350
Simulink project focused on photovoltaic

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,990
cells. But before we start, let me

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,850
clarify that this won't be a typical

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,630
tutorial in this video. I'm going to work

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,110
on this project live. You will witness my

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,510
mistake, see me search for solution and

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,290
witness those corrections. The beauty of

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,857
this kind of approach is that

11
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:26,309
You will not learn only from my

12
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:29,059
success, but also from my mistakes

13
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,439
along the way. So let's dive right in.

14
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:33,949
So first of all let's take the look what

15
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:36,559
will we need in this project. First open

16
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,789
the Simulink, double click and the search

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:39,601
bar will appear

18
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,040
Here is where we will select all the

19
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,900
essential blocks for this project.

20
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,480
The blocks will need is the solar cell,

21
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,290
PS constant ramp, variable

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,140
resistor, P Simulink converter, Simulink,

23
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,480
PS converter, product, voltage

24
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,240
sensor, current sensor, XY graph

25
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,540
solver configuration.

26
00:01:21,594 --> 00:01:24,284
Now let's discuss why we will

27
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,364
use converter blocks in Simulink.

28
00:01:26,994 --> 00:01:29,704
Physical system don't directly connect to

29
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,034
Simulink blocks because they are usually

30
00:01:32,094 --> 00:01:34,424
non directional like real physical

31
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:37,064
components. On the other hand Simulink.

32
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:39,754
Blocks require information about

33
00:01:39,804 --> 00:01:40,934
directionality.

34
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:42,988
Converter blocks actually bridge this

35
00:01:42,998 --> 00:01:45,608
gap. Yeah, PS Simulink

36
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:48,168
converter transform a physical signal

37
00:01:48,178 --> 00:01:50,908
into a Simulink output signal, which

38
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:53,348
can then be connected to a Simulink

39
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:56,328
block. Conversely, A Simulink

40
00:01:56,338 --> 00:01:58,908
PS converter transform A Simulink input

41
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,728
signal into a physical system ready to be

42
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:03,648
used in a  blocks.

43
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:09,008
Now let's get into a the wiring.

44
00:02:09,018 --> 00:02:11,488
This blocks. The variable

45
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,838
resistor block connects the connects in

46
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:16,198
series with the solar cell blocks,

47
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:19,158
responding the ramp signal from the

48
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:21,358
input port via ramp block.

49
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:24,791
Note that we use Simulink PS converter

50
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:27,021
between the ramp block and the variable

51
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:29,231
resistor block because they belong to

52
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:30,221
separate libraries.

53
00:03:32,323 --> 00:03:34,353
To measure the current and voltage of the

54
00:03:34,363 --> 00:03:36,993
circuit, we add the current sensor in

55
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:39,533
series and the voltage sensor in parallel

56
00:03:39,623 --> 00:03:40,825
to the variable resistor.

57
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:06,272
Because both the current and voltage

58
00:04:06,282 --> 00:04:08,952
sensor are physical system, we use

59
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:11,312
PS Simulink converter to display their

60
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:13,402
result in the XY graph block.

61
00:04:54,204 --> 00:04:56,274
To determine the overall power of the

62
00:04:56,344 --> 00:04:59,304
solar cell, we use the product block. It

63
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:01,014
multiplies the voltage and current.

64
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:03,549
The output will result in two curves.

65
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:05,709
The first curve represents P

66
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,179
characteristic curve and the second curve

67
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:09,759
is the V-I characteristic curve.

68
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,029
After connecting all the blocks, if we

69
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,269
run the simulation it will compile and

70
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,449
show us the I-V curves.

71
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:14,696
As you can see, our PV curve is perfect,

72
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:17,006
but the IV curve isn't ideal.

73
00:11:17,826 --> 00:11:19,996
Clearly I have made some mistakes

74
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:22,926
somewhere. The problem seems to

75
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:25,606
to be in the XY graph block. Yeah

76
00:11:25,656 --> 00:11:28,386
initially I had trouble understanding

77
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,266
it so I I did some research and

78
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:33,556
found out that the first X is represent

79
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:36,486
the X axis and the second axis is the Y

80
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:36,876
axis.

81
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:58,287
I correct the correction but if you

82
00:12:58,337 --> 00:13:01,167
didn't go well so

83
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:03,967
I also after some investigation I

84
00:13:03,977 --> 00:13:06,067
checked the solar cell block and found

85
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,107
that the short circuit current is

86
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:11,007
 7.34 MPR and the open circuit

87
00:13:11,017 --> 00:13:13,867
current is 0.6 . VoltI

88
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,567
adjusted the XY block accordingly

89
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:19,027
for the IV curve. The X axis

90
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:20,867
range from zero to

91
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:23,747
 0.7 as voltage. Voltage

92
00:13:23,757 --> 00:13:26,387
is on the X axis. With the

93
00:13:26,397 --> 00:13:29,347
maximum voltage of 0.6 Volt. That

94
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:32,177
way axis goes 4 zero to 8

95
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:34,767
as current is on the X axis

96
00:13:34,817 --> 00:13:37,277
while current on the Y axis and the

97
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:40,097
maximum current value is 7.34

98
00:13:40,097 --> 00:13:42,987
MPR. I also made adjustment on

99
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:45,467
the P-V blocks setting. The X axis

100
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:47,457
ranges from zero to 0.77

101
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:50,387
 Voltvoltage and the

102
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,947
Y axis from zero to 4 representing the

103
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,937
power. With these

104
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:58,707
changes then we will run the simulation

105
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:01,597
and we'll see that our curves are now

106
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,197
perfect.

107
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:07,257
OK, you can find the symbolic file in my

108
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:10,237
